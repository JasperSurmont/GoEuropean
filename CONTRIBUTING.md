# One rule to rule them all
Currently, I only allow contributions to the countryMappings.json.
If you want to add a website alternative to the countryMappings.json, please 
folllow these rules:
- The website alternative must be based in Europe.
- The website alternative must be a European alternative to a non-European website.
- If the website is in a language other than English, it must be set as a specificCountry

Then, create a pull request with the following information:
- Why the alternative is a good alternative
- Proof that the website is based in Europe (can be something as simple as info on the website).
